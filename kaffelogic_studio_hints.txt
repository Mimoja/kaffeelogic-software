ambient_temperature
basic
°
The ambient room temperature. This value is normally calculated by the roaster using probe data, but it can also be
entered by the user (for firmware v 7.5.0+).

back2back_count
expert
no unit
It is recommended that if carrying out multiple roasts in a single session the roaster be left turned on.
This is to allow the ambient temperature calculation to be performed correctly.
This number indicates the total number of roasts that have been done since the roaster was last turned on.

calibration_data
advanced
no unit
mains voltage reading, fan speed, cool down speed
<p>If roasting is uneven fan speed calibration might need to be increased. 
<p>Cool down speed calibration allows cool down speed to be adjusted to a slightly different value compared to roasting fan speed.
The recommended value of cool down speed calibration is 1.0 and this is not normally changed.
<p>Calibration can be changed only in calibration mode (turn roaster on with both - and + buttons held down).

cooldown_hi_speed
advanced
RPM
high speed at start of cooldown to quench roast fast
<p>Reducing this value is sometimes done to reduce the amount of beans
in the chaff for dark roasts. Beans are of lower density in darker roasts and more likely to get into the chaff.

cooldown_lo_speed

RPM
lower speed to use after the initial cooling is complete

cooldown_lo_temperature

The end of preheat stage 2. This is also the latest time at which preheat stage 1 will end.

preheat_min_power_offset
engineer
%
During preheat stage 2 the roast control system takes over, but reductions in power are limited by this setting.
It is a percentage reduction. (The preheat power is converted to a percent duty cycle for the heater element, this
number is subtracted from that to give the minimum percent duty cycle allowed during the second stage of preheat.)

engineer
min:sec
The earliest time at which preheat stage 1 will end.

preheat_mode

Preheat happens in two stages. This setting affects how the roast control system decides to move from stage 1 to stage 2.

preheat_nominal_temperature
engineer
°
The nominal temperature of air
entering the roast chamber during pre-heat at the default preheat power and
ambient temperature [[DEG=20]]°. If preheat power is set to less than
default, this is adjusted for automatically. <p>This setting affects initial applied pre-heat power, but otherwise
has no effect on the roast control system.

preheat_power
basic
Watts
This is the amount of heat that is applied to the beans during preheat stage 1.
This number is vital for initial following of the roast profile curve.
If this number is too big the roast will start off well above the line and you risk seeing the "Heat too fast" warning.
If this number is too small the roast will start off well below the line and you risk seeing the "Heat too slow" warning.

profile_schema_version

Kaffelogic level
The optimal level for the profile. It will be loaded along with the profile. After the profile is loaded the user is free to set a different level if they choose.

reference_temperature
engineer
°
The internal temperature of the main circuit board
 
roast_end_by_time_ratio
expert
no unit
The level that the user sets determines the point on the profile curve where the roast will end. This point is shown
as a red square <font color="red">■</font> on the roast profile curve.<p>
However, if the actual temperature does not follow the curve, the roast ends when the temperature curve crosses the
threshold line (faint red dotted line). Check the box labelled 'Grid' to see the threshold line.<p>
The slope of the threshold line is defined by 'roast end by time ratio'.<p><ul><li>
1.0 means roast ends at that time regardless of temperature. The threshold line is vertical.</li><li>
0.0 means roast ends at that temperature regardless of the time. The threshold line is horizontal.</li><li>
Numbers between 0 and 1 set the threshold line at different angles.</li></ul></p><p>
This allows you to make adjustments so that when a roast does not follow the line it should still finish after approx the same amount of development.

roast_levels
expert
°
This is a series of temperatures that define the thresholds for the roast levels. The first is the temperature for level 0, the next is the temperature for level 1, the next is the temperature for level 2, and so on. The decimal levels (0.1, 0.2, etc) are spread out equally across the interval to the next temperature. 
<p>You can manipulate these numbers so that actual roast darkness matches the name associated with each number (<i>light</i>, <i>medium</i>, etc) for the particular profile you are developing.  

roast_min_desired_rate_of_rise
basic
°/min
This acts as an anti-stall setting. If the bean temperature races ahead of the profile curve
this setting acts to prevent the control system stalling the roast in an attempt to get back onto the curve. The minimum rate of rise will be applied
until eventually the roast gets back onto the curve. 
<p>This number should always be smaller than the profile curve rate of rise, because the minimum rate of rise will be applied regardless.
If it is too large it will prevent the system from following the profile curve.

During the drying phase the beans lose water and their specific heat changes dramatically. Consequently the PID parameters Kp and Kd need to change. That change is achieved by multiplying the roast PID Kp and roast PID Kd by specific heat adj multipliers. 
<p>Below this temperature both multipliers are used at full value. Between this temperature and the upper temperature limit, the multipliers are adjusted linearly until they reach the value of 1.0.

zone1_boost
advanced
(°/min or %)
The number of °/min added to the desired ROR while in the zone. Use a negative number to decrease the desired ROR. This is used to
help keep the roast temperature following the profile curve at times when exothermic or endothermic changes are pushing it away. If the temperature
tends to go below the line use a positive boost; if it goes above the line use a negative boost.
<p><i>Expert level only:</i> Create a 'power profiling zone' by setting both multipliers to zero. This disables the PID control system within the zone
and the roaster will not respond to temperature changes at the bean probe. Power during such a zone is controlled by the boost, which defines
the percent increase in power within this zone. The power increase takes place regardless of the temperature at the bean probe. PID control
resumes at the end of the zone. A 'power profiling zone' can be used to flatten out parts of the roast where a sequence of exothermic and endothermic changes cause
